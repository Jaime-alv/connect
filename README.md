# CRM
 Customer Relationship Manager

# Work in Progress
You can create the server and toy with it, but it's not ready and there is no encryption, yet, for data.

# Set up
- Install python from https://www.python.org/ (_built under python 3.9_)
- Download repository [web_check.git](https://github.com/Jaime-alv/crm)

- Create a new virtual environment following the instructions in https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

    `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
- Activate said venv
- Install requirements.txt

    `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
- Script is ready!
- Run server with main.py

# What it does

Script creates a server where you can access all your clients' data, their phones, emails and telegram accounts and chat
with them with messages.
